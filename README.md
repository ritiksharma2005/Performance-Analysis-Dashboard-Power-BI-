- Clean and structure real-world, unorganized business data  
- Analyze sales performance across **zones, territories, dealers, and products**  
- Identify **high-performing and underperforming areas**  
- Evaluate **dealer margins and pricing consistency**  
- Support management decisions using **data-driven insights**

---

## ✅ Project Outcomes
By the end of this project, stakeholders will have:

- A **clean, structured dataset** derived from raw operational data  
- An **interactive Power BI dashboard** capable of handling large sales datasets  
- Clear visibility into **regional, dealer, and product performance**  
- Insights into **margin imbalance and revenue concentration**  
- Practical recommendations to improve **sales growth and dealer motivation**

## 🧠 Business Problems Addressed

| Business Problem | Description |
|-----------------|------------|
| Uneven Regional Performance | Some zones contribute significantly more revenue than others |
| Weak Dealer Network | Over-dependence on a few large dealers in certain zones |
| Margin Imbalance | Dealer margins vary widely despite similar MRPs |
| Underperforming Products | Some products show consistently low sales |
| Brand & Pricing Risk | Margin inconsistency may lead to parallel trading and trust issues |

## 📊 Key Dashboard Insights

### 🔹 Zone-Level Performance
- **High Performing Zone:** Lucknow  
- **Underperforming Zone:** Agra  

Lucknow contributes the highest revenue due to strong dealer presence, while Agra shows weaker sales due to fragmented dealer networks.

---

### 🔹 Territory-Level Performance
- **Top Territories:** Allahabad, Lucknow, Varanasi  
- **Low Performing Territories:** Basti, Meerut, JKC Varanasi  

This highlights the need for **targeted sales strategies** in underperforming territories.

---

### 🔹 Dealer Performance Analysis
- **Top Dealers:** Gupta Brothers, Raja Ram, New Gupta  
- **Underperforming Dealers:** Krishna Enterprises, Krishna Traders, ZFHL  

Sales are highly concentrated among a few dealers, increasing business risk.

---

### 🔹 Product Performance
- **Star Products:**  
  - PPL BHARAT NPK  
  - PPL BHARAT DAP White  

- **Top Products:**  
  - NAVRATNA  
  - PPL BHARAT TSP  
  - IMP DAP  

- **Underperforming Products:**  
  - Nano Shakti  
  - Urea Ammonium  
  - PPL DAP Dark  

Out of **21 total products**, only a few drive the majority of revenue.

---

### 🔹 Margin & Pricing Analysis
- Dealer margins range from **₹1.8K (JKC Varanasi)** to **₹6.1K (Meerut)**  
- MRP per unit remains relatively stable (**₹24K – ₹31K**)  

📌 **Key Insight:**  
The issue is **not customer pricing**, but **inconsistent dealer margin policies**, which can cause dissatisfaction and parallel trading.
